 Use these files, write python logic using Polars Lazy Frames read csv data on lazy frames, do the below aggregations to generate output in  JSON format,
Using that  generated JSON file, Create React component to show these aggregations results in a table format or some other data display what ever is feasible.  
Below are the required aggregation calculations that need to perform and provide grading as given
a. within credit score ranges 
    -- Differentiate Companies based on Credit Score like
 if credit score is above 85, it is type A company, 
if between 50 to 85 type B
between 35 to 50, type C
between 0 to 35 type D, 
less than 0 type E
b. within credit limit ranges
 if Credit Limit above 250K  type A 
if credit limit is 100K to 250K  type B
if credit limit is 50K to 100K Type C
if Credit Limit is below 50K type D
if Credit Limit is not available then Type E
c. within in turnover ranges
 if Credit Limit above 100K  type A 
if credit limit is 0K to 250K  type B
if credit limit is 50K to 100K Type C
if Credit Limit is below 50K type D
if Credit Limit is not available then Type E
d. Active and Inactive 
If 
e. Country wise Companies. 
f. Country wise Active and Inactive companies. 
For example if a company has credit_limit 175K give type B rating, if score having 88 give A rating etc.. 
and the output should be like 
[
{
safeNumber: "CMPXXXXX",
credit_score_type: A,
credit_limit_type: B, 
etc...
}
....
]
Using this Json, create the UI to show these details in a table..
